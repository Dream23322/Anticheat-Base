# Minecraft Bedrock Realm Anticheat base

What is an anticheat base?

An anticheat base is all the background code in one package so you can get straight to making checks, bypassing all the time and effort of making most of the background stuff.

Why should I use a base?

Because it is great for new devs, people who don't like making codebases and people who just want to get stuff done fast.

Is it safe?

Of course! It's 100% safe to download, I don't even think its possible to put a zip bomb in here, mainly because you download the code from the repo yourself, not from releases.
